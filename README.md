***This is somehow working atm, ( version 0.0.15)***

I have plans to add value converters for three major time libraries:

* [humanizeDuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanize-duration)
* [momentjs](https://github.com/moment/moment) and [Jalali moment](https://github.com/fingerpich/jalali-moment)
* [moment-timezone](https://github.com/moment/moment-timezone)
